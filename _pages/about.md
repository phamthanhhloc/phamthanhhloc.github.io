I am currently pursuing an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s in [Intelligent Field Robotic Systems](https://ifrosmaster.org/) at the University of Zagreb, Croatia, and previously at the Universitat de Girona, Spain. My academic path is driven by a deep passion for developing `autonomous robots` in challenging, dynamic environments.

My research explores `reinforcement learning` and adaptive control techniques to enable robots to operate autonomously and robustly, even under uncertain conditions. Additionally, I study `SLAM` and `VIO` for navigation, along with `path planning` strategies to enhance the capabilities of autonomous robots in dynamic environments.

Professionally, I have worked at [Viettel High Technology Industries Corporation](https://viettelhightech.vn/en) and [Viettel Aerospace Institute](https://vtx.vn/en), leading teams in the development of autopilot systems for UAVs. These included the `Kamikaze Drone` Project, where I designed control systems for attack-phase navigation based on real-time image processing; the `VTOL` (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) Drone Project, focusing on a transition controller; and a `Navigation System` Project for UAVs, where I developed a robust navigation system capable of operating in `GNSS-denied` environments using SLAM and sensor fusion techniques.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Control Engineering and Automation from Hanoi University of Science and Technology, where I gained a strong foundation in control theory, systems engineering, and autonomous systems.
